This project analyzes UK food establishment data using MongoDB, PyMongo, and Pandas. It includes two parts: cleaning and updating the database (adding, removing, and formatting documents), and analyzing hygiene rating trends and top-rated restaurants.

The analysis highlights highly rated establishments in London, identifies top 5 cleanest spots near a new halal restaurant, and breaks down local authorities with the most poor hygiene scores.

This challenge was completed for educational purposes. External resources, including documentation and instructional support, were referenced to resolve issues and ensure accuracy. All work follows project guidelines.
